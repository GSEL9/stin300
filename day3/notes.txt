* The factor() function is the scikit-learn equivalent of encoding categorical variables
  to numerical levels. Can specify levels among the original categories to consider. 
  Categories not specifically given are set to NA.
* The reorder() function shuffles the order of the levels in a factor according to a    criterion (e.g. the mean value of some vector/column)
