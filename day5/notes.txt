# NOTES LECTURE 5

Tidyverse `verbs`:
* select(): Extract variables from a data set by specifying a vector of labels to select.
* slice(): Select rows by position indexing.
* filter(): Extract a subset given a filtering criterion.
* arrange(): Sorting. Defaults to ascending. Use desc() for descending arrangement.
* mutate(): Add new variables to a data set while preserving the existing.
* summarise(): Compute descriptive statistics. Typically applied to grouped data.
* group_by():
* bind_cols()/bind_rows(): Concatenate data sets on columns/rows.

Cookbook: 
* To merge tables that are partly different (e.g. different column names), apply merge().
* To create a table where all observations are unravelled into a single column, apply gather().
* If ‘no tidyselect variables registered’ error is raised, try fixing by wrapping feature labels into the vars() function.

Functions applied to a range of columns (specified by `select_helper` functions):
* mutate_at() 
* summarise_at()
* filter_at()
