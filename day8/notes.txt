# NOTES LECTURE 8

* The difference between a vector and a list: Lists are `recursive` which means they can contain elements of different data types. Vectors can only hold numerical, character or logical elements. Additionally, all elements of a vector must be the same data type, while each element in a list may differ from each other.
* The difference between a table (data.frame) and a list: A data frame holds vectors of equal length rendering limitations to quivalent data types in each individual vector. 

Vector: All elements must be of the same data type. 
Matrix: Similar to a vector, but with two additional attributes (num of rows/cols).
Array: Similar to matrices, but can have more than two dimensions. 
List: Can contain elements of different types.
Data Frame: Stores data tables. A list of vectors of equal length.
Data Table: An inheritance of data frames, but with additional features. Extends the base R data frame. 

* Convert selected columns from a table to a matrix: as.matrix()
* Convert a matrix back to a table: as.tibble() or as.data.frame()
* Bind rows or columns to a table: bind_rows() or bind_cols()
* Bind rows or columns to a matrix: rbind() or cbind()
